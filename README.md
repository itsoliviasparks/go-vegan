# Go Vegan ðŸŒ±
How can you tell if someone is vegan? Donâ€™t worry, Theyâ€™ll tell you.

## About
A guilt inducing app that utilizes two APIs to fetch and display data in response to user interaction.

## Features
* Utilizes 2 API's, jQuery library, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
* Takes input from the user and fetches & displays data, updates & edits HMTL accordingly

## Limitations
I've utilized TheMealDB in this project. Although TheMealDB is great resource, their database of vegan recipes (at time of upload) is limited to only 2 recipes, unfortunately this leads to a less than ideal user experience.
